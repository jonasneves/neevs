          "summary": "The IRS has announced an increase in 401(k) contribution limits to $24,500 and IRA limits to $7,500 for 2026, reflecting adjustments for inflation and encouraging retirement savings among Americans with potential tax benefits.",
          "key_points": [
            "401(k) and IRA contribution limits increase by $1,500 each in 2026.",

It also doesn't consider the possibility of other policy changes or economic factors that could affect retirement savings.",
          "implications": "The increase in limits may encourage more Americans to save for retirement, potentially improving financial security for retirees. However, it may also lead to increased tax revenue for the government and could affect the behavior of savers, as the higher limits might also lead to larger tax deductions and a shift in how individuals plan for retirement.",
