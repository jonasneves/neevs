For Australian teenagers, it raises concerns about access to social media, potential impacts on social connections, and the ability to engage in digital spaces. For social media companies, it signals the increasing power and influence of government over corporate policy and the challenges of global platform regulation. This development may also inspire other nations to implement similar restrictions, potentially leading to a more fragmented internet where access to information and platforms is heavily regulated based on geographical and age-related criteria.",
