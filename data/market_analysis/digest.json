Notably, Ethereum (ETH) is exhibiting resilience with a +1.82% increase over the week, suggesting continued investor interest and confidence, possibly driven by ongoing developments in DeFi and NFT sectors. BNB's positive momentum (+2.49% over 7 days) may be attributed to Binance's continued innovation and user growth, while XRP's significant weekly decline of -7.39% could reflect ongoing regulatory concerns impacting its price. Looking ahead, the market may remain volatile as traders react to macroeconomic factors and regulatory news, with potential for upward movement if key resistance levels are breached.",
