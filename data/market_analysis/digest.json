Notably, Ethereum (ETH) has outperformed with a 3.36% increase over the week, suggesting positive momentum possibly driven by ongoing developments in decentralized finance and NFTs. Conversely, XRP has experienced significant downward pressure, declining 4.42% in the last 24 hours and 5.62% over the week, likely influenced by ongoing regulatory scrutiny and market reactions to its legal status. Looking ahead, the market may see continued fluctuations as traders assess macroeconomic factors and regulatory developments, but the overall strength of BTC and ETH suggests a potential for gradual recovery in bullish sentiment.",
