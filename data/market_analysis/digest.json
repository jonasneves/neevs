Notably, Ethereum has outperformed Bitcoin in the last 24 hours with a 5.12% increase, suggesting strong market momentum possibly driven by ongoing developments in DeFi and NFTs. XRP, on the other hand, has experienced a downturn of -1.67% over the week, reflecting uncertainty surrounding its regulatory status, which may be impacting investor confidence. Looking ahead, the market may continue to see upward momentum if Bitcoin maintains its rally, potentially drawing more institutional investments, while the performance of altcoins like BNB and ETH could signal broader market trends.",
