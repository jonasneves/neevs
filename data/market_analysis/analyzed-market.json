      "analysis": "The overall market sentiment appears to be bullish, as indicated by the positive weekly gains across major cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), which have seen increases of 9.51% and 11.90%, respectively. Notable trends include XRP's significant weekly rise of 16.76%, suggesting strong investor interest possibly driven by recent regulatory developments or partnerships that have renewed confidence in its utility. Bitcoin remains stable with minimal 24-hour movement, indicating consolidation at these high levels, while Ethereum is benefiting from broader market optimism and ongoing developments in the DeFi sector. Looking ahead, if the upward momentum continues and Bitcoin maintains support above $90,000, we could see further capital inflow into altcoins, especially those with strong fundamentals.",
