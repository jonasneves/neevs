      "analysis": "The current cryptocurrency market sentiment appears to be bearish, as evidenced by the significant weekly declines across major assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum down approximately 10.30% and 12.54% respectively over the past week. Notably, XRP has shown resilience with a 6.35% increase in the last 24 hours, likely driven by positive sentiment surrounding ongoing legal developments and increased institutional interest. Additionally, Bitcoin and Ethereum's modest daily gains may indicate a slight recovery attempt amidst the broader bearish trend. Moving forward, the market could continue to face volatility, and investor focus will likely remain on regulatory news and macroeconomic factors that could impact risk assets.",
