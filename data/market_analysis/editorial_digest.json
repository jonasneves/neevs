      "commentary": "Tech stocks took a nosedive faster than a kid on a poorly designed skateboard ramp. With earnings reports that felt like they were written by a rom-com screenwriter, investors had to choose between panic and a stiff drink. Spoiler: they mostly chose panic."

  "parting_thoughts": "As we wrap up this week, remember: the markets are like a high-stakes poker game where everyone seems to have a wild card. Keep an eye on interest rates and tech in the coming weeks, because if history has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the only certainty is unpredictability. Stay savvy, stay sharp!",
