It\u2019s like watching a magician pull a rabbit out of a hat, only for the hat to be empty. Who knew profit margins could be so... thin?"

      "commentary": "Meanwhile, in the bond market, it was all rainbows and unicorns. Investors flocked to the safety of bonds like kids to a candy store after a sugar crash. With stocks wobbling, bonds became the adult in the room, reminding everyone that sometimes stability is all we really want\u2014like a warm blanket on a cold night."

Investors still treat these digital currencies like the holy grail, despite the fact that they\u2019re just pixels on a screen, occasionally making the Pythagorean theorem look stable in comparison."
