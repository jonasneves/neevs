Apple slipped after another underwhelming iPhone launch and Meta decided that a reminder of the metaverse\u2019s abysmal returns was necessary. It\u2019s like they all agreed to have a group therapy session at the expense of our portfolios!"

It\u2019s like when your friend brings a sweater to a party because they just know someone will get cold. Bond yields dipped as investors sought safety, proving that sometimes, predictability is the best flavor in a market ice cream shop."

One minute they\u2019re soaring to the moon, the next they fall like a toddler on a sugar high who just discovered gravity. It\u2019s a thrilling ride, but let\u2019s be honest, most of us are just here for the show, popcorn in hand!"
