  "intro": "Ah, another week of market drama where tech stocks pirouetted in a ballet of earnings, inflation whispers, and good old-fashioned investor anxiety. In an arena where every tweet matters more than a Supreme Court ruling, it\u2019s clear: the tech titans are feeling the heat, and so are we.",

      "commentary": "This week, tech stocks took a dive faster than a kid on a slip-and-slide. With Apple\u2019s latest earnings looking more like a reality check than a celebration, investors are wondering if the once-invincible sector has finally met its kryptonite. Spoiler alert: tech may not be dead, but it sure is bruised."

      "commentary": "Inflation showed up to the party again, and let\u2019s just say, it didn't bring dessert. As the S&P 500 wrestled with economic data that felt like a punch to the gut, safety assets like gold and consumer staples got a second wind. Turns out, when the going gets tough, the tough get\u2026 boring?"

Bitcoin is back to being the rebellious teen in the family, showing off its volatility for all the neighbors to see. Meanwhile, Ethereum's staking is gaining traction faster than your uncle on a new conspiracy theory."

    "reason": "Watching Meta this week was like witnessing a soap opera unfold \u2013 the drama, the heartbreak, and of course, the inevitable cliffhanger. With all the talk about its metaverse dreams being dashed, it\u2019s both absurd and fascinating how a company that practically invented social media is now stumbling through its own identity crisis."
