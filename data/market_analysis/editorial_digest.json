      "commentary": "This week, tech stocks were about as stable as a toddler on a sugar rush. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta all faced sell-offs as investors realized they can\u2019t simply reboot a bad economic outlook with a software update. It\u2019s like watching a group of well-dressed folks trying to dance on a sinking ship\u2014comedic, but also kind of tragic."

While tech floundered, the bond market saw a surge as investors fled to safety\u2014because nothing says 'I\u2019m responsible' like buying a bond. Apparently, the thrill of coupon payments trumps the rollercoaster of tech stocks right now. Who knew?"
