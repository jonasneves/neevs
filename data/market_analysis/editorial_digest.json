With rising interest rates whispering sweet nothings in investors\u2019 ears, these giants took a hit, reminding us that even the mightiest can stumble. It\u2019s like watching King Kong trip over his own giant feet.",

Bitcoin is up, then down, then up again, as if it\u2019s auditioning for a dramatic role in a financial thriller. At this point, volatility is basically its middle name.",

If that isn't the most ironic thing we\u2019ve heard all year, I don\u2019t know what is. It's like buying a brand new sports car only to find out it requires premium gas... every day!"

Watch for further inflation indications, interest rate whispers, and whether tech can bounce back like a rubber ball or will just deflate into oblivion.
