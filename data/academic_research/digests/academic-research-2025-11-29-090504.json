It emphasizes that knowing the nature of these interactions is key to making better decisions based on data.",

This paper suggests that instead of figuring out exactly how each friend connects to every other friend, you can still make good guesses about how popular a restaurant will be based on how friends affect each other. It's all about understanding the flow of influence.",
