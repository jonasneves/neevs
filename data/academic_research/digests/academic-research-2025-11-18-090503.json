Prevailing semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods are ill-suited for this task, as they suffer from catastrophic confirmation bias and ignore the intrinsic data manifold. We propose ST-ProC, a novel graph-prototypical multi-objective SSL framework to address these limitations. Our framework synergizes a graph-prototypical cor...",
