This paper describes a method where the robot first searches for good sentences using a clever strategy, then learns from those sentences to create its own. By repeating this process, the robot gets better at writing over time.",

An open question, however, is how human rationales fare with these automatic metrics. Analyzing a variety of datasets and models, we find that human rationales do not necessarily perform well on these metrics. To unpack this finding, we propose improved metrics to account for model-dependent basel...",

This study looks at two ways of checking if a computer can explain its answers correctly: comparing it to how humans explain theirs, and seeing how these explanations affect the computer's decisions. The researchers found that human explanations don\u2019t always score well on these checks, leading them to suggest better ways to evaluate these explanations based on the specific computer model used.",
