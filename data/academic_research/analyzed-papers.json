The researchers investigate how these functions can improve training stability and model performance.",
          "eli5": "In deep learning, we often use normalization layers to help models learn better, much like how a tutor helps students understand complex topics. However, this paper suggests that we can use different mathematical functions instead of these layers, which could make training faster and more effective. The authors are looking for new functions that can not only match but beat the performance of the current best alternative.",

In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operatio...",
