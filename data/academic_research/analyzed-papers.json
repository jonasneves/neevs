This paper discusses a way to teach the robot to follow the rules and play nicely, even after it has already learned to play without those rules. It does this by tweaking how the robot makes decisions while it's actually playing, rather than starting its training all over again.",

As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] in...",
