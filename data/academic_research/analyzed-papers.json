Running this process on unlabeled videos produces trajectories of (caption, score) pairs. We convert the ...",

Instead of making them learn how to see from scratch, you team them up with a buddy who\u2019s great at interpreting pictures (the smaller model). Together, they can create a better understanding of both words and images, making learning and problem-solving easier and less expensive.",

However, UMMs still exhibit a fundamental inconsistency: understanding favors compact embeddings, whereas generation favors reconstruction-rich representations. This structural trade-off produces misaligned decision boundaries, degraded cross-modal coherence, and heightened vulnerability under distributional and adversarial shifts. In this paper, we present UniGame,...",
