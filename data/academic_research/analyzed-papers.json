Instead of just one robot trying to figure everything out alone, these robots can communicate and make decisions based on their strengths and the specific challenges of different areas. This paper shows how using a team of these agents, each with special skills, can restore power more effectively and quickly than traditional methods.",

By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ideal $I$ in $\\mathbb{Q}[r,r_1,r_2,\\ldots]$ we can find a conclusive result. It plays an important role...",
