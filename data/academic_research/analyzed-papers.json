This paper looks at how we can ask a language model (like a super-smart robot) for multiple opinions and then combine those opinions in a better way to reach a clearer decision.",

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while mainta...",
