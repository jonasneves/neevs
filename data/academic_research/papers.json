However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks\nreveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which\nresults in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal\nrouting. In this paper, we show that aligning the manifold of routing weights\nwith that of task embedding can effec...",
