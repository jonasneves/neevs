To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to...",
