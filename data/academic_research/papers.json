Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't exhibited by base models? Our work, SkillFactory, is a method for fine-tuning models to roughly lea...",

For example, enumerating multiple possible user intentions is cumbersome on small screens or in a voice setting. In this wor...",
