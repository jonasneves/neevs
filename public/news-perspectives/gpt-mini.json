Levenbach's lack of financial experience raises concerns about his suitability for the role, especially at a time when the CFPB's effectiveness is already under scrutiny.",

            "Stuart Levenbach has been nominated as the new CFPB director, despite having no prior experience in finance.",
            "This nomination occurs within a larger context of the Trump administration's attempts to close or significantly reduce the CFPB's power.",
