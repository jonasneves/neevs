            "The energy sector in Ukraine has been a hotbed for corruption, and recent raids and investigations indicate a serious effort to clean up the industry.",
            "The pushback from anti-corruption agencies could signal a strengthening of democratic institutions in Ukraine, but it also underscores the challenges they face.",
