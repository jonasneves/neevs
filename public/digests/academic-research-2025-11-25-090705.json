            "tldr": "This paper introduces Genie-CAT, an advanced tool that combines the power of large language models with various scientific techniques to speed up the design of proteins, particularly metalloproteins. It\u2019s like giving researchers a supercharged assistant to help generate and test new ideas quickly.",
            "eli5": "Imagine you're trying to build a really cool robot, but you don't know exactly how to do it. Genie-CAT is like a smart friend who not only knows a lot about building robots but can also find the best instructions and tools to make your robot work better. In this case, the 'robots' are proteins that can do important things in biology.",
