Notably, XRP has emerged as a key mover, gaining 2.15% in the last 24 hours and 7.80% over the past week, possibly driven by positive developments or market speculation surrounding its legal status and adoption. Conversely, BNB's slight 24-hour decline of 1.49% contrasts with its marginal weekly gain, indicating mixed investor sentiment. Looking ahead, the market may remain cautious, with traders closely monitoring regulatory developments and macroeconomic factors that could influence price movements across major cryptocurrencies.",
