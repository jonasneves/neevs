With production delays and whispers of competition, it\u2019s like watching a high-speed chase where you're rooting for the underdog\u2014except the underdog is a car company with a trillion-dollar valuation."

Keep your eyes on inflation and tech stocks as we march forward; they might just lead us into the next episode of market shenanigans.
