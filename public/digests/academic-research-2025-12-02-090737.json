The authors of this paper found a smart way to cut the sandwich into smaller, manageable pieces (NVFP4 quantization) that not only fit better but also taste great (maintain performance). They focused on ensuring that these smaller pieces don\u2019t lose their flavor (accuracy) during the cooking process (training and inference), making everything work together nicely.",

While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) can decompose hidden activations into more fine-grained, interpretable features, they often struggle to reliably align these features with human-defined concepts, resulting in entangled and distributed feature representations. To address this, we introduce AlignSAE, a method that aligns SAE features with a defined ontology through a \"pre...",
