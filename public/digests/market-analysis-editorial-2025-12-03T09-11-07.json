      "commentary": "In the land of crypto, Bitcoin and friends decided this week that a little volatility is just part of the fun. As Bitcoin bounced between highs and lows like a caffeinated rabbit, investors are left wondering if they\u2019re backing a digital currency or an emotional rollercoaster.

After a sharp drop, it\u2019s clear investors are either really into electric cars or are just playing an elaborate game of market chicken. Who knows? Maybe next week they'll announce a car that runs on optimism."

Tech stocks are on shaky ground, crypto remains a dance of unpredictability, and bonds are stealthily rising.
