Ethereum (ETH) is one of the notable performers with a 24-hour gain of +0.67% and a weekly increase of +1.01%, suggesting strong underlying demand, potentially driven by ongoing developments in DeFi and NFTs. BNB also shows resilience with a +1.35% increase in the last 24 hours, likely supported by positive sentiment surrounding its utility in the Binance ecosystem, while XRP's significant weekly downturn of -7.39% may reflect ongoing regulatory concerns and market apprehensions. Overall, in the near term, the market could remain range-bound as investors await further catalysts, with a focus on macroeconomic factors and regulatory updates that could influence sentiment.",
