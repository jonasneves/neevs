Notable trends include Ethereum's stronger weekly performance (+5.20%) compared to Bitcoin's modest gains (+2.48%), which may indicate increased investor interest in altcoins as they look for growth opportunities. XRP stands out as a key mover with an impressive 7-day increase of +8.61%, likely driven by positive regulatory news or developments that enhance its utility and market confidence. Looking forward, the market could experience continued fluctuations, but the overall upward trajectory suggests that investors remain optimistic about the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies, particularly as institutional interest and adoption grow.",
