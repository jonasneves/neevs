  "intro": "Welcome to another week where the markets behaved like a toddler on a sugar rush\u2014unpredictable and slightly unhinged. As tech stocks grapple with gravity, crypto enthusiasts are having the time of their lives, proving once again that reality is just a suggestion in the crypto verse.",

      "commentary": "This week, the tech titans took a collective swan dive, with investors clutching their pearls over inflation fears and interest rate talk. It\u2019s like watching a group of high-flying birds realize they forgot how to land gracefully\u2014cue the awkward flapping and flopping."

Moving forward, keep an eye on inflation reports and tech earnings\u2014because markets love a good plot twist almost as much as we do.",
