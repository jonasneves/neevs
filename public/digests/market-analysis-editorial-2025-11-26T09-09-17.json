Apple and its friends are suddenly feeling more like insecure teenagers than futuristic innovators. Is it a momentary stumble or a sign that they've peaked?

With its price fluctuations, you\u2019d think it was the protagonist in an action movie, constantly high on adrenaline and dangerously unpredictable. Will it crash, or is this just another plot twist in an ongoing saga? Stay tuned!"
