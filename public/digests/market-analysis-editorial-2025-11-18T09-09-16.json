With earnings reports coming in less sparkling than a disco ball, it seems like investors finally decided to stop bingeing on overpriced \u2018innovations\u2019 and start looking for value.

As we roll into next week, keep an eye on those inflation numbers\u2014they're more unpredictable than your uncle after a few drinks.
