      "commentary": "Cryptocurrencies continued their time-honored tradition of moving in ways that make absolutely no sense to anyone outside (and let's be honest, inside) the crypto space. Whether it's up, down, or sideways, there's always someone on Twitter claiming they predicted it all along."
